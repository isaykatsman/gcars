# OCaml Genetic Cars
Our final project is a genetic algorithm that optimizes a 2D car design. It was
made with the Chipmunk2D physics library for collision detection/simulation. 

# Running the Project
First, you will need to install the dependencies for Chipmunk2D and OpenGL.
(We should provide a script to do this inside the 3110 VM).

Then, run the build_deps.sh script to build the dependencies.
You can then run the project by running the run.sh script.
