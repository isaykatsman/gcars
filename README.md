# gcars
CS3110 Final Project - Genetic Cars in OCaml. Made with the Chipmunk2D physics library for collision detection/simulation.

In order to run the demo, build glMLite and Chipmunk (install dependencies for OpenGL and chipmunk-dev), and copy the build files to the root _build folder of the gcars repo.
