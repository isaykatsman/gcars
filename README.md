# OCaml Genetic Cars
Our final project is a genetic algorithm that optimizes a 2D car design. It was
made with the Chipmunk2D physics library for collision detection/simulation. 

# Running the Project
First, you will need to install the dependencies for Chipmunk2D and OpenGL. To do this, run ./getdependencies.sh . Then run the project with ./run.sh . For the on-screen prompt, press enter to use the default mutation rate, and then the simulation window should pop up.
