# OCaml Genetic Cars
Our final project is a genetic algorithm that optimizes a 2D car design. It was
made with the Chipmunk2D physics library for collision detection/simulation. 

# Running the Project
First, you will need to install the dependencies for Chipmunk2D and OpenGL. To do this, run ./getdependencies.sh . Then run the project with ./run.sh . For the on-screen prompts, press enter for each to use the default values for the simulation, and after the final prompt the simulation window should pop up.
